LARIS: Ligand And Receptor Interaction in Spatial transcriptomics data
======================================================================

LARIS is a Python package for analyzing ligand-receptor interactions in spatial transcriptomics data. It identifies spatially-specific cell-cell communication patterns by integrating gene expression, spatial information, and cell type annotations.

Features
~~~~~~~~~

- **Spatial LR interaction strength:** Calculate ligand-receptor interaction scores using spatial adjacency information

- **Spatial specificity:** Identify LR pairs with significant spatial variable patterns

- **Inference at cell type level:** Compute sender-receiver cell type interaction scores

- **Spatial neighborhoods:** Analyze interactions in the context of spatial cell type neighborhoods
